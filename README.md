# IR(MA) Review Zomato Scraper

### Prerequisites

ChromeDriver
Python
- pip

```

### Install
```
pip install requests (if using API)
pip install selenium

```

### How to

python zomato-scraper.py [snippet url restaurant]

Example url: https://zomato.com/jakarta/warunk-upnormal-tebet/reviews
Go run python zomato-scraper.py warunk-upnormal-tebet

Note:
Selenium isn't consistent sometimes, so this program will perfectly work if you trigger the driver first like clicking the all reviews and load more button until the driver scrolling and clicking button by itself
